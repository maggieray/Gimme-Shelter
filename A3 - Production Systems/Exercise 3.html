<b>Aims of the Assignment</b>
<p>
This assignment has two purposes. The first is to give you experience
with production system representations and with methods that manipulate 
them. To complete the exercise, you must implement systems that encode
knowledge as production rules and that uses them to carry out cognitive 
tasks. A second purpose is to expose you to programming with hierarchical
task networks, which can be implemented as sets of production rules. 
</p><p>
Production systems are a class of rule-based formalisms that, like logic 
programs, rely centrally on relational pattern matching, but that differ 
by mimicking the cyclic operation of human cognition over time. The 
production system framework you will use for this assignment, PROPS, 
has a syntax similar to that in Prolog, the language in which it is 
implemented. This provides it with powerful pattern-matching abilities 
that will prove useful for the assignment. 
</p><p>
As explained in the lecture on production systems, a program in this
framework utilizes two stores: a working memory that changes dynamically
and a production rule memory that is (typically) static. You will find 
an introduction to the language's syntax and operation at
</p><p>

</p><p>
Briefly, each working memory element should take the form of a Prolog
fact, and thus should have a predicate and zero or more arguments. Each 
production rule should have a left-hand side that comprises a set of 
conditions and a right-hand side that specifies one or more actions, 
the most important being actions that add elements to working memory 
or that remove them. You can download the PROPS interpreter at

</p><p>
rename it to be <i>props.pl</i>, 
and load the file into Prolog to run your production system program. 
You may not modify the PROPS interpreter for this assignment; you may
only create production rules that it runs. 
</p><p>
<b>Part A: The Seriation Task</b>
</p><p>
This part of the exercise focuses on the task of <i>seriation</i>, 
which has been studied extensively by Piaget and other psychologists 
interested in cognitive development. Given a set of objects like
</p><p>   
</p><pre>     A height 1 width 3
     B height 2 width 2
     C height 3 width 1
</pre>
<p>   
one must position the objects in a sequence according to their 
size along a specified dimension. For instance, adopting height 
as the criterion attribute should produce the (descending) order 
C B A. In contrast, making width the criterion dimension should
give the order A B C. 
</p><p>   
This appears to be a simple sorting task, but young children 
have considerable difficulty accomplishing it and they seem 
to traverse a number of stages in their performance that involve
mastery of distinct cognitive abilities. Young (1972) reports 
a production system model of these stages on the seriation task. 
We will not focus on cognitive development here, but we will see
that seriation is not as trivial as it seems.
To help you become familiar with PROPS, we have provided English 
paraphrases of six production rules that together carry out this 
task correctly. You must translate these paraphrases, available at 
<a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci367s2c/assignments/ex3/seriate.txt">seriate.txt</a>, 
into correct PROPS syntax and ensure that your system sorts objects
properly. On its last cycle, the program should print "Finished sorting 
on <i>dimension</i>.", where <i>dimension</i> is the sorting criterion. 
</p><p>
Your rules must be general enough to work with any criterion
attribute, such as <i>height</i>, <i>width</i>, or <i>weight</i>. 
Because we have not provided a simulated environment, the system 
cannot physically move the objects. Instead, you should mimic such
actions by adding elements to working memory that describe spatial 
relations. More specifically, to encode the sequence of objects 
C B A, where C is leftmost and A is rightmost, working memory should
contain the elements <i>left_of(c, b)</i> and <i>left_of(b, a)</i>. 
Your seriation program should <i>not</i> utilize any lists, only
predicates with arguments. 
</p><p>
Demonstrate that the production system works correctly by running it 
on the initial environments provided in 
<a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci367s2c/assignments/ex3/sort1.txt">sort1.txt</a> 
and 
<a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci367s2c/assignments/ex3/sort2.txt">sort2.txt</a>, which involve the same four objects and which
differ only in the criterion dimension. The representation of working
memory elements in these files will constrain the production rules that 
operate over them. Trace the production firings that occur during the
run and display the contents of working memory after the system finishes.
If you like, you may also trace selected contents of working memory on 
each cycle, but this is optional. 
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>Part B: Inverting a Tower</b>
</p><p>
For Part B of the exercise, you should use PROPS to construct a simple
hierarchical task network for the blocks world that inverts an existing
tower. You should assume that environmental states are described with 
five predicates: 
</p><p>
</p><pre>    block(a), which states that a is a block; 
    table(g), which states that g is a table; 
    hand(h), which states that h is a hand; 
    on(a, b), which states that a is on b, where b is a block or a table; 
    holding(h, a), which states that block a is held by hand h. 
</pre>
<p>
We have provided production rules in <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci367s2c/assignments/ex3/blocks.txt">blocks.txt</a> 
that encode four primitive operators for this domain: <i>pick_up</i>, 
<i>unstack</i>, <i>put_down</i>, and <i>stack</i>. For instance, the 
rule for unstacking X from Y is: 
</p><p>
</p><pre>unstack
  if task(unstack(X, Y)) and
     block(X) and block(Y) and hand(Z) and
     on(X, Y) and not(on(_, X)) and not(holding(Z, _))
  then remove(task(unstack(X, Y))) and
       remove(on(X, Y)) and add(holding(Z, X))).
</pre>
<p>
Note that, besides having conditions that describe the environmental 
state, this rule also includes a condition that there is an active 
task to unstack X from Y. Thus, it will not match unless such a task
is in working memory. 
</p><p>
You should extend this production system by adding exactly <i>six</i> 
rules that, combined with the four operator rules, will invert any 
specified tower. For example, if the situation includes <i>on(d, c)</i>, 
<i>on(c, b)</i>, <i>on(b, a)</i>, and <i>on(b, table)</i>, and if the 
system is given <i>task(invert_tower([d, c, b, a])</i>, then it should 
apply a sequence of rules that produce the working memory 
<i>on(a, b)</i>, <i>on(b, c)</i>, <i>on(c, d)</i>, and <i>on(d, table)</i>. 
The rules that you add should not affect the environment state directly, 
but rather only add new subtasks that, eventually, lead to the firing
of operator productions that alter it. 
</p><p> 
Your rules should include a single task condition, zero or more
environmental conditions, and the addition of one or more subtasks to
working memory. The order in which the rule adds these subtasks is
important. The PROPS conflict resolution scheme favors rules that 
match against elements added more recently to working memory, but
if the action side of a rule adds two tasks, T1 and T2, to memory, 
the interpreter treats T1 as more recent than T2. Thus, it will select 
a rule that matches against T1 over a rule that matches against T2, 
unless it has already fired the former on an earlier cycle. This 
means that, if you create a production rule that creates two or 
more subtasks, they should appear in the action side in the order 
that you want the system to pursue them.
</p><p>
The most natural way to approach this problem, and the one you should
use, is through recursion. Your program should have: 
</p><ol>
<li>
A rule for the base case that handles removing the top block from the 
original tower and placing it on the table; 
</li><li>
A rule for the recursive case that handles moving each block that it 
is neither the topmost or bottommost from  the tower to the new tower; and
</li><li>
A rule for the termination case that handles moving the block at the 
base of the original tower (and thus on the table) to the top of the 
new tower. 
</li></ol>
To support these three high-level production rules, you should also 
write three intermediate rules for: 
<ol>
<li>
Unstacking a block and putting it on the table; 
</li><li>
Unstacking a block and immediately placing it on another one; and 
</li><li>
Picking up a block from the table and stacking it on another block. 
</li></ol>
These three rules should each create subtasks that invoke the primitive 
operators we have provided for the blocks world. 
You should also include a <i>seventh</i> new production that detects
when the inversion process is complete and prints the result, as in 
"I have inverted the tower to produce [c,b,a]." The rule should not 
create a new subtask; it should only print out the new tower's elements
and invoke the <i>end</i> command. 
<p></p><p>
Demonstrate that the program works correctly by running your production 
system for clearing blocks on the initial environments provided in
<a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci367s2c/assignments/ex3/tower2.txt">tower2.txt</a>, 
<a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci367s2c/assignments/ex3/tower3.txt">tower3.txt</a>, and 
<a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci367s2c/assignments/ex3/tower4.txt">tower4.txt</a>. 
On each run, trace the rule firings and display the contents of working 
memory at its completion. However, your code should be general enough to 
invert any tower, provided there are no unmentioned blocks on top of it
or below it.

<h4>
<b>Marking Guidelines for Assignment (six (6) total marks)</b>
</h4>
We will grade the answers that you provide for this assignment based on
both the structure of your PROPS programs and their behavior: 
<ol>
<li>
   The maximum score for Part A is two (2) marks. 
   You will receive one-half (1/2) mark for each test file on which your 
   code sorts objects in the correct order, from smallest to largest. You 
   will receive one (1) mark if your rules correctly translate the English 
   paraphrases that we have provided into PROPS syntax. 
</li><li>
   The maximum score for Part A is four (4) marks. 
   You will receive one-half (1/2) mark for each test file on which 
   your code moves blocks in the correct order to produce an inversion 
   of the original tower. Your program cannot place all blocks in the
   original tower on the table and then build a new tower. Rather, it
   must construct the new tower as it is deconstructing the initial
   placing, putting no more blocks on the table than necessary. You 
   will receive one (1) mark for correct versions of the three rules 
   that handle the <i>invert_tower</i> task and one (1) mark for 
   correct versions of the three rules that handle the subtasks 
   <i>unstack_and_put_down</i>, <i>unstack_and_stack</i>, and 
   <i>pick_up_and_stack</i>. You will receive one-half (1/2) mark
   for a correct version of the rule that prints the results of 
   successful inversion. 
</li></ol>
Submit your final programs in two separate files, one each for Part A
and B; you should name these <i>PartA.pl</i> and <i>PartB.pl</i>, 
respectively. In each file, include all production rules, including 
those we have provided. This file should NOT contain the initial 
working memory, which can differ across runs, or the trace commands 
you use in your runs; it should only contain the productions that are 
common to runs on different tasks. Also submit two additional files 
that contain your runs, one each for Part A and B; you should name 
these <i>PartA.run</i> and <i>PartB.run</i>, respectively. In each 
run file, you should display the contents of working memory after 
each system run, and you should trace the productions that fire 
on each cycle during the various runs. Include successive runs on
different tasks (i.e., when loading different working memories) in 
a single file.
<p>
Deposit your programs and traces in the 
<a href="https://adb.auckland.ac.nz/Home/">Computer Science Assignment
Dropbox</a> before the assignment deadline. <i>Note:</i> If you
submit your assignment after the deadline but within 48 hours after
it, your earned marks will be multiplied by 0.8, so that, in the best
case, you will get no more than 80 percent of the possible marks. We
will not accept assignments more than 48 hours after the deadline.
