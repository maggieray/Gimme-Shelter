% English paraphrase of a PROPS program for the seriation task that, 
% given a set of objects, positions them (mentally) from right to 
% left in order of increasing value along the criterion dimension.

initiate_smaller
  if A is the criterion and X is an object and 
     X is not sorted and there is no smallest object, 
  then try to find the smallest object on A and 
       label X as (initially) the smallest on A. 

update_smaller
  if you are trying to find the smallest object on A and 
     and X is (currently) the smallest on A and 
     X is an object with value V1 on A and 
     Y is an object with value V2 on A and 
     V2 is less than V1 and Y is not sorted
  then unlabel X as the smallest on A and 
       label Y as (currently) the smallest on A. 

end_smaller
  if you are trying to find the smallest object on A
  then stop trying to find that object and 
       try to sort on criterion A. 

initiate_sort
  if you are trying to sort on criterion A and 
     X is the smallest object on A and 
     nothing has yet been sorted
  then stop trying to sort on criterion A and 
       unlabel X as the smallest object on A and 
       note that X has been sorted and 
       note that X is the latest object processed and
       refresh that A is the criterion. 

extend_sort
  if you are trying to sort on criterion A and 
     X is the smallest object on A and 
     Y has been sorted and 
     Y is the latest object processed 
  then stop trying to sort on criterion A and 
       unabel X as the smallest object on A and 
       note that X has been sorted and 
       unlabel Y as the latest object processed and 
       note that X is the latest object processed and
       place X to the left of Y and 
       refresh that A is the criterion. 

end_sort
  if A is the criterion
  then print that you have finished sorting on A and 
       halt. 

Note: You can "refresh" an element in working memory by removing 
      it and then adding it again. This will overcome refraction
      for any rule instance that matches against the element.
